## Unified HMI support layer (meta-uhmi)
"Unified HMI" is a common platform technology for UX innovation in integrated cockpit by flexible information display on multiple displays of various applications. Applications can be rendered to any display via a unified virtual display.

Unified HMI consists of two main components.

* Remote Virtio GPU Device(RVGPU): Render applications remotely in different SoCs/VMs.
* Distributed Display Framework: Flexible layout control of applications across multiple displays.

The meta-uhmi currently supports x86, Raspberry Pi4, and Renesas Boards platforms.
There are two layers under meta-uhmi to support these two frameworks.

## RVGPU support layer(meta-rvgpu)
RVGPU rendering engine, operating on a client-server model, creates 3D rendering commands on a client device and transmits them to a server device via the network, where the server-side device performs GPU-based rendering and displays the results.

The meta-rvgpu currently supports `agl-image-weston`, `agl-ivi-demo-qt`, `agl-ivi-demo-flutter` as build images.

RVGPU is OSS. For more details, visit the following URL: [Unified HMI - Remote Virtio GPU](https://github.com/unified-hmi/remote-virtio-gpu)

## Distributed Display Framework support layer(meta-distributed-display-fw)
Distributed Display Framework is an open-source software layer that provides essential services for managing distributed display applications. This framework is designed to work with a variety of hardware and software configurations, making it a versatile choice for developers looking to create scalable and robust display solutions.

Now, the meta-distributed-display-fw only supports build images that run on weston and for which the wayland-ivi-extension is available like `agl-image-weston`.

Distributed Display Framework consists of three main components.

* [ucl-tools](https://github.com/unified-hmi/ucl-tools): Unified Clustering Tools (UCL), launch applications for multiple platforms and manage execution order and survival.

* [ula-tools](https://github.com/unified-hmi/ula-tools): Unified Layout Tools (ULA), application layout for virtual displays on virtual screen (mapped from physical displays).

* [uhmi-ivi-wm](https://github.com/unified-hmi/uhmi-ivi-wm): apply ivi-layer and ivi-surface layouts to the screen using the layout design output by ula-tools.

For more details about these frameworks, please visit our GitHub repository at the attached URL.

## How to build
Follow the [AGL documentation](https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/master/#01_Getting_Started/02_Building_AGL_Image/01_Build_Process_Overview/) for the build process, and set up the "[Initializing Your Build Environment](https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/master/#01_Getting_Started/02_Building_AGL_Image/04_Initializing_Your_Build_Environment/)" section as described below to enable the AGL feature 'agl-uhmi'. For example:
```
$ cd $AGL_TOP/master
$ source ./meta-agl/scripts/aglsetup.sh -m qemux86-64 -b qemux86-64 agl-demo agl-devel agl-uhmi
```
After adding the feature, execute the command:
```
$ bitbake <image_name>
```
Replace the `<image_name>` with the appropriate values you want. We have confirmed the operation with the **agl-image-weston**.

## How to setup and boot
For Environment setup instructions for each platform, refer to the following link in the AGL Documentation.
[Building for x86(Emulation and Hardware)](https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/master/#01_Getting_Started/02_Building_AGL_Image/07_Building_for_x86_%28Emulation_and_Hardware%29/)
[Building for Raspberry Pi 4](https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/master/#01_Getting_Started/02_Building_AGL_Image/08_Building_for_Raspberry_Pi_4/)
[Building for Supported Renesas Boards](https://docs.automotivelinux.org/en/master/#01_Getting_Started/02_Building_AGL_Image/09_Building_for_Supported_Renesas_Boards/)

For Raspberry Pi 4 and Supported Renesas Boards, refer to the above URL for boot methods.
For x86 emulation (qemu), network bridge is required to enable communication with other devices when using RVGPU. Hereâ€™s an example procedure for your reference.
```
$ sudo ip link add <bridge_name> type bridge
$ sudo ip addr add <IP address> dev <bridge_name>
$ sudo ip link set dev <interface> master <bridge_name>
$ sudo ip link set dev <bridge_name> up
```
Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values:
- `<bridge_name>`: You can assign any name, for example: `br0`
- `<IP_address>`: Enter an available IP address, for example: `192.168.0.100/24`
- `<interface>`: Specify the network interface, for example: `eth0`

To enable the use of the bridge, create or append /etc/qemu directory and /etc/qemu/bridge.conf file.
```
allow <bridge_name>
```
Make sure /etc/qemu/ has 755 permissions.
Create the following bash file named **run_qemu_bridge.sh** in any `<WORKDIR>`.
```
#!/bin/bash

KERNEL_PATH=$1
DRIVE_PATH=$2
BRIDGE_NAME="<bridge_name>"

printf -v macaddr "52:54:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x" $(( $RANDOM & 0xff)) $(( $RANDOM & 0xff )) $(( $RANDOM & 0xff)) $(( $RANDOM & 0xff ))

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2048 \
    -kernel ${KERNEL_PATH} \
    -drive file=${DRIVE_PATH},if=virtio,format=raw \
    -cpu kvm64 -cpu qemu64,+ssse3,+sse4.1,+sse4.2,+popcnt \
    -vga virtio -show-cursor \
    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0,mac=$macaddr \
    -netdev bridge,br=$BRIDGE_NAME,id=net0 \
    -serial mon:stdio -serial null \
    -soundhw hda \
    -append 'root=/dev/vda swiotlb=65536 rw console=ttyS0,115200n8 fstab=no'
```
Save the file and run the following to start QEMU.
```
sudo <WORKDIR>/run_qemu_bridge.sh <build_directory>/tmp/deploy/images/qemux86-64/bzImage <build_directory>/tmp/deploy/images/qemux86-64/agl-image-weston-qemux86-64.rootfs.ext4
```
When QEMU boot, you can log in to qemu on the terminal where you executed above command, so please assign an IP address there.

For example:
```
ifconfig <your environment> 192.168.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
```
